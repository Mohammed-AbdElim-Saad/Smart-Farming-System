-> Camera module:
-> To set up the configuration of Camera you must first set the communication between controller and the camera
-> so you need to Know what is the SCCB(Serial Camera Control Bus):
-> Specs:
-> 1- Wired		2- serial		3- Synchronous		4- master/slave		5- half duplex
-> it's 2-wire serial bus that allow one master and one slave
-> The Camera always acts as a slave
-> Pin functions for slave device:
-> SIO_C input: Active high and sending Data is done when it low , SIO_D I/O
-> so we can see that the SCCB can configured by using I2C by:
-> we need a function that send the slave address then reg address then data
-> from data sheet the slave address for write is 0x42 and for read 0x43
-> so what is the configurations of Camera:
		1- Choose output format (COM7[2][0],COM15[5][4]) we need one of two format
			-> (YUV 4:2:2)(00x0)		-> RGB565(1001)	
		2- Choose resolution
		3- Frame rate timing:
			1- clock pre-scaler:
					if you want to use external clk(set_bit(CLK RC, bit 6))
					else use DBLV[6][7] for PLL and CLKRC[5:0] for pre-scaler
					F(internal clk)=fclk*PLL/(2*pre-scaler+1)
-> The important registers for us:
		1- COM3 bit 2 -> used for enable scaling
		2- CLK RC: bit 6 -> used for enable external clock
		3- com7 bits[5->0] the output format
		4-
