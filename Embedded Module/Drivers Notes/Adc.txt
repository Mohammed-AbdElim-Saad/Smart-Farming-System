-> ADC
-> we have 3 ADCs every ADC has 16 external channel and ADC1 has three internal channels(temp, Vbat, nc)
-> the 15 channels can be regular or injected channels and injected has priority over regular
-> A regular group conversion can be interrupted by an injected trigger.
-> the injected channels mangement:
	-> triggered injection: by SW trigger or external trigger
	-> Auto injection: the channels in the injected group are automatically converted after the regular group of channels
-> the ADC clock is shared by all 3 ADCs so it will be taken in config.h
-> every ADC has Analog watchdog that fires if the input of a channel is over the high threshold or lower than the low one.
-> The high and low threshold and channels guarded by watchdog is configured by user
configurations:
-> choose ADC
-> Choose channel
-> modes (Single, continuous, Scan, discontinuous)
		-> Single conversion mode: used to do one conversion(regular or injected)
		-> continuous mode: the ADC start a new conversion as soon as it finishes one(used for regular mode only)
		-> The only state that the injected mode is working in the continuous mode if and only if the injected channel
			is configured to be converted automatically
		-> Scan mode: used to scan a group of channels(injected or regular)
			if the cont bit is set the conversion won't stop at the last channel
		-> discontinuous mode: used for regular and injected channels and it starts by external trigger
			-> regular channels: it can convert up to 8 channels per trigger and at first trigger it converts n channels
				and in the next trigger it converts the next n and when it finish all channels it starts from the first
				There is interrupt generated at the end of every conversion
			-> injected channels: it can convert up to 4 channels per trigger and like the regular in conversion but it
				generats interrupt at the end of every sequence of conversion
				discontinuous mode can't work with auto injected mode, you must choose one mode
			-> you must use discontinuous mode for one group at a time (regular or injected)
->channel selection(regular, injected)
		-> regular group: is composed up to 16 conversions
		-> injected group: is composed up to 4 conversions
-> resolution:(6 bit : 12 bit : 2)
-> Result alignment(left, right)
-> conversion source(SW, external trigger)
